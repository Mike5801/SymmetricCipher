# Symmetric Cipher

A symmetric cipher that encrypts text in blocks of 128 bytes using confusion and diffusion techniques, and a changing private key.

It uses diffusion techniques such as column and row rotations, and confusion techniques like XOR and substitution with two alphabets. The private key was changed to add more complexity by applying a Rubik’s cube algorithm (R U R’ U’) in its matrix.
